# COMP5541 - Main Project

### Introduction

This project is a Dietary Management Application, written in Java. The purpose of the app will be to organize ones daily diet plan according to the foods consumed, as well as providing basic information about these foods (e.g. food groups, servings, and calories).

### Prerequisities

As noted previously, the project is written in Java. Most members are using Java 11, although the project will at a later date be modified to work on both desktop and mobile platforms, and so JavaFX will be used. JavaFX is no longer included in versions 11 and above, and so it must be installed separately if one of the versions is being used. See the following link for instructions:
